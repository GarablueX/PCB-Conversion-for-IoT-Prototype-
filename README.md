# PCB Conversion for IoT Prototype  

This repository contains the design files and documentation for converting a wired prototype (ESP board, Raspberry Pi, sensors, and accelerometer) into a custom **PCB-based system**.  

The work was done as part of supporting a personal/student project, with the goal of moving from a breadboard/prototype stage to a **clean, reliable, and non-wired PCB solution**.

## 🛠️ Project Overview  

- **Initial Setup**: A wired prototype with ESP, Raspberry Pi, accelerometer, and other sensors.  
- **Problem**: The wired setup was bulky, unreliable, and difficult to reproduce.  
- **Solution**: Redesigned the system into a **single PCB**, reducing wiring and improving stability.
